Colorwheels and Emoticons 

* There are 2 color wheels with 12 colors each. You can pick the colors you like for each wheel. 
  * (kuler.adobe.com could be helpful in picking colors)
* In the middle of the color wheels, there is a walking/running man. 
  * There is an included asset in the project or you can build your own as well.
* The card shows one of 72 emoticons.
  * There is an included asset in the project or you can build your own as well.

Interactions:
* By dragging the two color wheels down, you can start spinning them. 
  * The faster you drag them they will accelerate and spin faster. 
  * The two men in the middle of the two wheels should run facing each other as the wheels spin. The running should speed up and slow down with the acceleration/decelaration of wheels.
* Once you stop dragging them, the wheels should start slowing down. And finally when both stop, the color combination in between the two wheels will be the selected one.
* There are 12x12 selections possible and 72 emoticons available. 
  * Map those selections to one emoticon. (Since there are less emoticons, some will show for more than one selection.)
* When both wheels stop, wait for 1sec and then show the card (as shown in wireframe) with the emoticon inside. 
  * The card should start (animation) showing from the intersection and grow to the top of the 2 wheels (as shown in wireframe)
  * Use an ease-out type animation and bounce the card 2 times at the end between smaller and bigger sizes.
* When you click on the card, it should clear by tearing into 10+ pieces (think off an exploding type animation)
* The scene is set up again with the wheels for the next spin.

Instructions:
* Use Javascript, HTML5, CSS. The app should run on Chrome, Safari and Firefox, latest versions.
* Code quality is as important as functionality.
* Do not hesitate to show your artistic skills either. The look and feel is up-to-you. We included some assets but you are free to choose your own.
